              <p className="py-3 px-2 font-light text-justify">
                3.1. Applicable fees for the provision of Services shall be
                levied by Razorpay from time to time. You agree that the fees
                shall be charged according to the manner, rates and frequency
                determined by Razorpay. Razorpay reserves the right to update
                the amount of the fees charged at its sole discretion. Razorpay
                fees allow access to the entire suite of payments products,
                dashboard and custom reports, and includes MDR charges, if any,
                for payment instruments as prescribed under applicable
                guidelines. For clarity, Razorpay fees include zero MDR for
                Rupay Debit Cards and UPI transactions. 3.2. Fees are exclusive
                of applicable taxes and Razorpay will charge such applicable
                taxes on the fees from time to time. You agree that any
                statutory variations in applicable taxes during the subsistence
                of these Terms shall be borne by You. 3.3. We will raise monthly
                invoices in respect of fees charged for Services provided during
                such month. Invoices are available on the dashboard on a monthly
                basis. Any dispute in respect of an invoice must be communicated
                by You to us via a notice no later than ten (10) days from the
                date of the invoice. Razorpay shall use good faith efforts to
                reconcile any reasonably disputed amounts. 3.4. You shall be
                responsible to do reconciliation on a daily basis for all the
                transactions processed. In case of discrepancies, You shall
                report to Razorpay regarding such discrepancy within three (3)
                days upon the receipt of the funds. Razorpay shall not be liable
                for any reconciliation issue if the same is highlighted by You
                to Razorpay after such time. 3.5. For fees deducted upfront
                before provision of the specific Service, it is agreed that if
                You deposit applicable taxes under Section 194H of the Income
                Tax Act, 1961 (in respect of invoices received by You) and
                furnish to Razorpay Form 16-A in respect of such taxes paid,
                then Razorpay shall reimburse to You, on a quarterly basis, the
                amount in respect of such taxes paid. In all other cases, with
                respect to invoices received by You, at the time of payment of
                the Fees, You will withhold applicable taxes under Section 194H
                of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (in case LTDC is provided as per the
                LTDC issued). You shall deposit the withheld taxes with the
                government treasury, file the statutorily mandated returns and
                furnish the requisite tax deduction certificate (Form 16-A) to
                Razorpay within one hundred and eighty (180) days so as to
                enable Razorpay to obtain full credit for the taxes deducted at
                source. 3.5 A. If You operate as an e-commerce operator,
                facilitating the sale of goods or provisions of services of a
                resident e-commerce participant, You shall evaluate and comply
                with the requirements of TDS under Section 19.40 of the Income
                Tax Act, 1961. You, as an e-commerce operator, will withhold tax
                under Section 19.40 of the Act and deposit the same within the
                applicable timelines, including carrying out all the necessary
                compliances as prescribed under the Income Tax Act, 1961. As the
                payment service provider, Razorpay would not be obligated to
                deduct tax under Section 19.40 and the same will be Your
                responsibility as the e-commerce operator. For the purposes of
                this clause 3.5A, &quot;e-commerce operator&quot; and
                &apos;e-commerce participant&apos; shall have the meaning assigned to them
                in section 19.40 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. 3.6. You shall be
                solely responsible for updating Your GST registration number on
                the Razorpay dashboard before Razorpay generates the invoice and
                shall also submit the GST certificate as part of KYC. Razorpay
                will raise a GST tax invoice and report the transactions in the
                GST returns based on the information provided by You. The GST
                returns will be filed as per the statutory timelines, to enable
                You to avail appropriate input tax credit. Razorpay shall not be
                responsible for any mistake and or misrepresentation by You in
                updating the GST number and other particulars as per the GST
                certificate. Further, any liability raised on Razorpay by the
                GST authorities due to incorrect information provided by You or
                deliberate withholding of any statutory information by You shall
                be recovered by Razorpay from You. 3.6A In order for Razorpay to
                issue a proper B2B tax invoice under the GST law and to ensure
                GST input credit is available to You, Razorpay shall record Your
                correct GSTIN. Towards this, You are advised to verify Your
                GSTIN and registered address captured within the account
                maintained with Razorpay at periodical intervals and correct the
                same wherever necessary. In the event, correct GSTIN is not
                updated in Your account maintained with Razorpay, then You shall
                be solely responsible in respect thereof and Razorpay shall not
                be liable to accommodate any request for revision of invoice and
                / or amendment to GST reporting.

                payment networks have infrastructure and processes to enable
                transaction authorisation. The card payment networks require You
                to comply with all applicable guidelines, rules, and regulations
                formulated by them. 10.2. The card payment networks reserve the
                right to amend their guidelines, rules and regulations from time
                to time. We may be required to amend, modify or change these
                Terms pursuant to amendments to the Card Payment Network Rules
                and such amendments, if any, shall be deemed to be binding on

                sites. 10.4. In the event that Your non-compliance of Card
                Payment Network Rules, results in any fines, penalties or other
                amounts being levied on or demanded of us by a card payment
                network, then without prejudice to our other rights hereunder,

                agencies to either suspend the Services, or part thereof, or
                directs to suspend the Services or part thereof regardless of
                whether there is pending investigation/enquiry into any alleged
                illegal/unlawful activities. (d) You use the Services for any
                transactions which have a high-risk score as per Razorpay&apos;s
                internal fraud assessment tools and other policies. (e) Razorpay
                is of the opinion that there are suspicious circumstances
                surrounding Your activities. (f) Razorpay is of the opinion that
                there are pending, anticipated, or excessive disputes, refunds,
                or reversals relating to Your use of Services. (g) Your
                products/services infringe, or are suspected of infringing,
                intellectual property rights, copyrightable works, patented
                inventions, trademarks and trade secrets, or You are suspected
                of selling counterfeit and/or knock-off goods. (h) You
                materially change the type of the products/services provided to
                end customers and as declared on the onboarding form, without
                obtaining Razorpay&apos;s prior written permission to use the
                Services for the new or changed types of services/products, or
                it is discovered by Razorpay that You provided substantially
                misleading and/or false information about Your products/services
                as part of the onboarding activities. (i) Razorpay in its sole
                discretion determines that Your activities expose Razorpay to
                risks which are unacceptable to Razorpay. (j) Razorpay in its
                sole discretion is required to do so due to regulatory changes
                impacting the Services. 16.2. These Terms are effective upon the
                date You first access or use the Platform or Services and
                continue until such access and use is terminated by You or
                Razorpay. Unless you have a separate offline agreement in
                relation to use the Services, or any part thereof, these Terms
                will apply. We may terminate these Terms or close Your Razorpay
                account at any time for any reason (including, without
                limitation, for any activity that may create harm or loss to the

                termination. 16.3. Termination does not immediately relieve You
                of obligations incurred by You under these Terms. Upon
                termination, You agree to stop using the Services. Your
                continued or renewed use of the Services after termination
                serves to renew Your consent to the Terms. In addition, upon
                termination You understand and agree that we will not be liable
                to You for compensation, reimbursement, or damages related to
                Your use of the Services, or any termination or suspension of

                non-3D secure services or not and additional terms for the same

                Request shall forthwith deduct Chargeback Amount from the
                Transaction Amounts, which may be used, based on the decision of
                the Facility Provider, either to a) process Chargeback in favour

                aforesaid Transaction; and /or; (ii) delivery of goods/services
                sought by the customer pursuant to the said Transaction. You
                shall furnish the Chargeback Documents within three (3) calendar
                days (or such other period specified by the Facility Provider)

                Documents; and /or; (ii) the Facility Provider is not satisfied
                with the Chargeback Documents furnished by You, then the

                a reversal of the debit of the Chargeback Amount associated with
                the Chargeback such that the said Chargeback Amount is credited
                to the customer&apos;s Payment Instrument. 2.3. Notwithstanding
                anything in these Terms, if the Facility Providers charge the
                Chargeback Amount from Razorpay then You agree and acknowledge
                that Razorpay is entitled to recover such Chargeback Amount from
                You by way of deduction from (i) the Transaction Amounts to be
                settled to You and (ii) any of Your other funds held by Razorpay
                in the course of providing the Services. Provided however, if
                the available Transaction Amounts or other funds are
                insufficient for deduction of the Chargeback Amount, then
                Razorpay is entitled to issue a debit note seeking reimbursement
                of the Chargeback Amount. You shall reimburse the Chargeback
                Amount within seven (7) days of receipt of the debit note. 2.4.

                hundred and twenty (120) days (“Withholding Term”) from the date
                of termination of these Terms. The sums so withheld shall be
                utilized towards settlement of Chargebacks. After processing
                such Chargebacks, Razorpay shall transfer the unutilized
                amounts, if any, to You forthwith upon completion of the
                Withholding Term. The ‘Stipulated Percentage&apos; is the
                proportion of the Chargeback Amounts out of the total
                Transaction Amounts settled during the subsistence of these
                Terms. 2.5. Notwithstanding anything in the Terms, if the amount
                withheld pursuant to clause 2.4 above is insufficient to settle
                Chargebacks Amounts received during the Withholding Term, then
                Razorpay is entitled to issue a debit note seeking reimbursement
                of the Chargeback Amount. You shall reimburse the Chargeback
                Amount within seven (7) days of receipt of the debit note. 2.6.

                4.1 Charges associated with the provision of Services to the
                Merchant and Device Rentals (“Fees”) shall be in accordance with
                the pricing terms agreed to by the Merchant at the time of
                subscribing to the Services on the Website. The Merchant agrees
                that such Fees shall be charged according to the manner, rates
                and frequency specified in the said pricing terms. All Fees will
                be deducted from the monies required to be settled to the
                Merchant. However, if the Device rentals are not deducted from
                the transaction settlement amount then the same will be deducted
                from e-nach /e-mandate set up by the Merchant at the instruction
                of Razorpay POS. 4.2 The Parties agree that the Fees are
                exclusive of applicable taxes and Razorpay shall charge such
                applicable taxes on the Fees from time to time. It is agreed
                that any statutory variations in applicable taxes during the
                subsistence of this Agreement shall be borne by the Merchant.
                4.3 In the event of any delay in payment of any amounts to
                Razorpay beyond the due date of payment, Razorpay at its sole
                discretion may opt one or more of the following remedies: i.
                Charge a late payment interest at the rate of 15% per annum on
                the due amount; ii. Suspend some or all of the Service(s) it
                provides under this agreement, until payment of the due amount.
                Consequently, it is agreed between the parties that Razorpay
                shall not be liable for any loss, damages, claims including
                third party claims, which may result owing to suspension of some
                or all of services by Razorpay in case of non-payment or delayed
                payment. iii. Set off the due amount from the transaction
                settlement amount payable to the Merchant.
